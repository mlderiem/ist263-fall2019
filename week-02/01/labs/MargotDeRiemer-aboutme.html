    <p>Hi, My name is Margot De Riemer and I am a Senior in Newhouse majoring in Advertising with an emphasis in Digital Advertising and minoring in Information Management and Technology in the iSchool. </p>
    <p>I am from Connecticut and I have two older brothers and a new puppy named Roo. I live close to New York City so I've been going there my entire life. When I graduate, I hope to move to New York City after traveling for a month or two.</p>
