        <h1>What to Do in New York City</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>If you like art...</h2>
            <h3>Metropolotain Museum of Art</h3>
            <img src="met1.jpg" alt="MET" style="height:100px;widows:200px;">

                <p>This is one of the most iconic spots in the city, and if you are visiting the area and haven't been to the MET, it
                  should be an absolute priority. My favorite room is the Egyptian Room, but the limited-time editions are always 
                 a must-see as well. Try to time your visit when you can visit the roof of the museum- it is a hidden gem!

        <h2>If you want the best place to watch the sunset...</h2>
        <h3>Grand Banks</h3>
        <img src="grandbanks.jpg" alt="Grand Banks" style="height:100px;widows:200px;">

            <p>I never knew I loved dining on a boat in the middle of Manhattan until I visited Grand Banks! This Tribeca-docked 
                boat offers incredible views, a fun crowd, and a perfectly decorated deck to enjoy your perfectly mixed cocktails
                and fresh oysters. This is a great spot to start your night- make sure to make a reservation more than a month in 
                advance- this boat is "reely" knot" an experience you'll want to miss!
