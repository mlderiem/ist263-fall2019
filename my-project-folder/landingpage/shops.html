        <h1>Where to Shop in New York City</h1>
        <h2>For a full shopping experience...</h2>
            <h3>Restoration Hardware (Chelsea)</h3>
            <img src="hardware.jpg" alt="Restoration Hardware" style="height:100px;widows:200px;">

                <p>You may have visited a Restoration Hardware previously, but this one is unlike anything you've experienced. 
                    The glass elevator will bring you up to the fifth floor where you can dine or enjoy the rooftop- this is 
                    furniture shopping like you've never experienced! 
                </p>

        <h2>For a great boutique...</h2>
            <h3>The November 19th</h3>
            <p>This privately owned boutique is tucked right in the middle of Hell's Kitchen. The somewhat crowded yet 
                charming store is stocked with beautiful wallets, stunning scents, and thoughtful cards, among many other
                treasures. If I am ever in the area, I alwways make an effort to come.
