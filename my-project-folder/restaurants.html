                 <p>The Public House Hotel is the perfect spot for dinner if you want a fancy yet fun setting before a night out in the 
                 East Village. After spotting the iconic red escalator on your way in, head downstairs to the restaurant to be greeted 
                 with high ceilings and a cool ambiance. If you go, make sure to order the fried seafood appetizer and taste the fried lemon!</p>

                    <p>This was one of my favorite meals I've ever had- partially because the food was incredible, but also because
                        the dining experience was completely unique. At Dirt Candy, your vegetarian-based meal comes in six courses.
                        Expect to be wow-ed by DIY lettuce tacos and melting mushroom chocolate for dessert. If you want extra brownie
                        points, read the illustrated "Dirt Candy: The Cookbook" before visiting!
