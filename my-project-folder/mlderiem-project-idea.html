		<p>For my project, I will be making a website about how to travel around New York City. I will be writing about my favorite spots in the city, giving the readers ideas of what to do.  For my different pages, they will be my favorite restaurants, favorite shops, and favorite ideas of what to do in the city. </p>
        <p>I will write the text content and use my both my own pictures and public domain pictures to fill the website.>
